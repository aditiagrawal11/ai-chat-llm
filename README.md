# AI Chat LLM ü§ñ

An intelligent chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM), built using Hugging Face Transformers and Flask. This project demonstrates how to integrate a pretrained LLM (like GPT-2) into a modular Python application with preprocessing, API endpoints, and test coverage.

## üöÄ Features
- Text-based chatbot interface
- Uses GPT-2 (~124M) or GPT-2 Medium (~345M) via Hugging Face
- Configurable generation parameters (temperature, top-p, max length)
- Modular codebase: model, preprocessing, API, and tests
- Sample conversation data for training or testing
- Flask-based REST API for integration
